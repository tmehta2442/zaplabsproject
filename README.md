# ZapLabs
This is my submission for ZapLabs. The project was a lot of fun: got to build using gulp, create my own grid system and deployed the site to GitHub pages.

You can view a live version of the project [here](https://tmehta2442.github.io/zaplabsproject/).

## Getting Started
If you want to build this on your own machine verify that you have at least Node v4.4.4, NPM v3.8.3 and Gulp 3.9.1 (this current build was built using Node v5.10.1, NPM v3.8.3 and Gulp 3.9.1 and those versions are recommended for this project). If you have neither, please go [here for Node & NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) and [here for Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-install)

### Gulping
Once you have verified that you have the above installed and gtg go to the folder where the *zaplabsproject* resides and verify that you see *package.json*.

Next
```
npm install
```
then we have a few options:
```
gulp //this will open the app in a browser and live reload if you update code
```

```
gulp build //this will build the /dist folder
```

```
gulp deploy-build //this will build and deploy the app to GitHub Pages
```

## Notes
### Built files & GitHub Pages
I have not committed any built code; outside of the index.html page which was stitched together from the partials.

If you want to see the built version of this page go [here](https://github.com/tmehta2442/zaplabsproject/tree/gh-pages). This is my gh-pages branch and is exactly what can be viewed online.

### Testing / QA
I did a decent amount of crosss OS & browser testing using Browser Stack. If you haven't used it I HIGHLY reccommend it. It has virtually every combo of OS/Device/Browser you could possibly imagine with different versions of each.

I did testing on Win10: Edge 14 & 13, IE11, FF49, Chrome53; Win8: IE10, FF49, Chrome 52; iOS: iPhone SE, 6, iPad Air 2; Android: S7, Note4, Nexus6; OSX Sierra & El Capitan: Safari 10, Chrome 53.
